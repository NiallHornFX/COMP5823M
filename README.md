#### COMP5823M : Animation & Simulation - Projects

###### Niall Horn - University Of Leeds (2021)

____

This repository contains 3 projects I completed as coursework for COMP5823M based around animation and simulation within computer graphics. This module was taken during my MSc at University of Leeds in 2021/2022. 

Due to my prior experience in this domain, I found the projects relativity simple, I tried to write clean and efficient code, some of which is re-used across each project. 

##### Projects

* **A1_Kinematics:** BVH Forward Kinematics.
* **A2_MassSpring_Cloth:** A Mass-Spring based Cloth solver. 
* **A3_SPH_Fluid:** A 2D SPH Fluid solver.

##### Building

I don't intend for people to build this code (its more of a portfolio piece), however if you do, please bear in mind this module was Windows based and hence the Visual Studio toolchain is required for building.
