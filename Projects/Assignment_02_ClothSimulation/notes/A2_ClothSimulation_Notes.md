#### Initial Notes

I'm not going to have time to write many notes for this one, its mass spring based, i've done this before. However even though this is based on a 2D plane / flat piece of cloth its required to implement this via a loaded obj mesh, using edges as springs (ie only distance springs) however I may add shear and dihedral (although this is a bit ambiguous with an instructed obj mesh). 

The base of the app is my "Viewer Application" I wrote for A1 but without any of  the animation code ofcourse, this gives me a nice basis, with a GUI to add the solver into. 

Basic Collision detection with a sphere primitive (defined parametrically, rendered using a sphere mesh).

Integration will be based on Semi Implicit Euler and possibly if I have time I will add another scheme like RK2 or RK4.
