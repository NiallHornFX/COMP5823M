##### Cognitive Modelling / AI 

* **Rule-Based**
  * <Condition, Behaviour> with motion databases / anim cycles, traditional AI approach. 
* **Machine Learning**
  * No specific rules, only data correlations. 
  * Causation detection (harder)
* **Deep Learning**
  * "Brute Force" learning from a large amount of data.
  * A working progress

##### Aggerate Behaviours

Flocks, Crowds. 

Flocking, Craig Reynolds 87 - Boids paper. Each agent avoid colliding with neighbours and follow the general formation

Crowd modelling for stampedes and crushing, > 7 people per square meter leads to problems.
